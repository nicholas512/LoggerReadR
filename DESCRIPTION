Description: Data loggers for environmental science data can be configured to output text files
    in any number of flavours. Differences in date formats and separators, or the presence of
    extra metadata in header rows can make it hard to easily and consistently open data logger 
    files for further processing. A script that one scientist uses to read their files can fail 
    when trying to open files that were configured differently, even when the data are from a
    sensor of the same make and model. This makes it harder for scientists to share data and use
    a common set of tools for quality control and analysis of observational data.
      'LoggerReadR' is a library of text-file readers for permafrost-related data loggers meant to 
    open files as 'dataframes'. Instead of trying to make a single 'csv-reader' that can
    handle any format, 'LoggerReadR' treats each data logger manufacturer separately; this makes it possible to
    open files automatically with greater confidence that they're being read properly. 
    'LoggerReadR' can be used as a standalone library for interactive data analysis and 
    exploration, or can be integrated into other programs. 
      Currently, data from the following sensors are supported: ('Geoprecision', 'HoboWare').
